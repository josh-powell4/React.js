# React.js
In this repository I will log my experience and skill obtained while learning React.js. from tutorials and online courses. 

Reasoning for learning: 
- Obtain knowledge
- Obtain new skill
- Desired/Required skill for positions of interests I applied for.

Recently I attended a webinar for a "Three" letter ageny apart of the intelligence communitty and learned that React.js is a highly sought after skill.
